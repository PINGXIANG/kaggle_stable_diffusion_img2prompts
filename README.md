# kaggle: Stable Diffusion Img2prompts
My first project at Kaggle

- **Task**: reliably invert the diffusion process that generated to a given image.
- **Motivation**: Grappling with understanding the relationships between prompts and the images
  - Is adding "4k" to a prompt the best way to make it more photographic?
  - Do small perturbations in prompts lead to highly divergent images? 
  - How does the order of prompt keywords impact the resulting generated scene?
- **Remark**: Prompt is scored in embedding version (e.g., "epic cat" ~  "majestic kitten")
